                    To better grasp what’s happening among 2020 Trump voters, I
                    spoke with Sarah Longwell, a lifelong conservative and
                    political strategist who is now the publisher of
                    <em>The Bulwark</em>, a news and opinion website that is
                    home to anti-Trump conservatives. She is also the founder of
                    Republican Voters Against Trump, now the Republican
                    Accountability Project.

                  <p>
                    Since 2018, Longwell has spent hundreds of hours speaking
                    with and listening to Trump voters. From 2018 to 2020, she
                    concentrated her attention on people who voted for Trump in
                    2016 but whose support was not locked in for 2020—many of
                    them college-educated, suburban voters, mostly women who
                    rated Trump’s performance as bad to very bad. Since Trump
                    left office, she’s been using her focus groups to understand
                    how his supporters’ views are changing.

                  <p>
                    Longwell has discovered that these voters, including many in
                    Georgia who cast their ballots for Trump in November, have
                    since grown more “Q curious”—she’s hearing more people talk

                    Prior to November 3, 2020, Longwell told me, “I almost never
                    heard QAnon come up, except in a way that was derisive.” But
                    postelection she’s had people “lean in and say, ‘I’m not
                    saying I believe everything about Q. I’m not saying that the
                    JFK-Jr.-is-alive stuff is real, but the deep-state pedophile
                    ring is real.’” (The QAnon theory is that

                      group’s leader</a
                    >.) In Longwell’s words, “The
                    deep-state/conspiracy/Hollywood pedophile ring, that is in
                    there. I’m hearing that plenty.” She added, “It’s actually
                    pretty Marjorie Taylor Greene–like.” (Greene, who represents
                    Georgia’s Fourteenth District, has praised the conspiracy
                    theory and

                  <p>
                    As Longwell explained it to me, Trump supporters already
                    believed that a “deep state”—an alleged secret network of
                    nonelected government officials, a kind of hidden government
                    within the legitimately elected government—has been working
                    against Trump since before he was elected. “That’s already
                    baked into the narrative,” she said. So it’s relatively easy
                    for them to make the jump from believing that the deep state
                    was behind the “Russia hoax” to thinking that

                    A second finding, according to Longwell, is that for the
                    first time, she’s hearing people say they pretty regularly
                    tune in to Newsmax or One America News Network, two
                    conspiracy-theory-minded MAGA television news outlets. She’s
                    heard from some people in her focus groups that “Fox has
                    gone too far left.” Overall, what she sees isn’t Trump
                    supporters fleeing Fox in huge numbers so much as
                    experiencing some cooling of their enthusiasm and a
                    willingness to look to other sources of information. (Tucker
                    Carlson, the most malicious and influential figure at Fox
                    News, does have a certain rock-star status in MAGA world.)

                    Finding No. 3 is that many Trump voters believe the 2020
                    presidential election was fraudulent. Not everyone Longwell
                    has spoken with believes that absent fraud, Trump would have
                    won, though many do. (<a

                    with fraud, despite the fact that the Trump administration’s

                    “Everybody thinks dead people voted,” Longwell said, adding,
                    “There’re plenty of people who say, ‘I think Donald Trump
                    won. This was stolen from him. This is Democrats cheating.
                    They figured it out. They know how to cheat better.’”

                    A fourth trend Longwell has noticed in her focus groups is
                    the rise of whataboutism. She’ll point out to participants
                    that Marjorie Taylor Greene

                    that the Parkland and Sandy Hook shootings were staged;
                    Longwell then asks them what they make of that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If compelling evidence is presented to MAGA supporters that
                    what they’re being told by Greene or others is a lie, they
                    don’t engage directly with the evidence. According to
                    Longwell, “They say, ‘What about Ilhan Omar?’ They say,
                    ‘What about [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]?’” As Longwell puts
                    it, “They’ve got these things down, which is ‘Whatever you
                    just showed me about Marjorie Taylor Greene is irrelevant
                    because Ilhan Omar, because AOC, and I know lots about that,
                    and I can tell you all about it.’” Some focus-group
                    participants report that they like how Greene “speaks her
                    mind.”

                    Greene raised $3.2 million during the first quarter of 2021.
                    That’s a staggering sum, especially for a freshman member of
                    the House, and she

                    the lesson she has taken from it: “I stood my ground and
                    never wavered in my belief in ‘America First’ policies and
                    putting people over politicians! And I will NEVER back down!
                    As a matter of fact, I’m just getting started.” The fact
                    that Greene has been criticized for her views actually works
                    to her advantage; she is tapping into the grievance culture,
                    the “own the libs” mentality, that right now dominates the
                    Republican Party.

                    “Right-wing media has primed people for two very clear
                    reactions to avoiding any confrontation with the bad thing
                    that’s going on, on their own side,” Longwell explained.
                    “And that is to say, ‘What about the left? What about this
                    example of Democrats?’—that’s No. 1. And No. 2, ‘Why does
                    the media never talk about that?’ So the media is as much an
                    enemy as Democrats, and they believe that they’re connected
                    to each other in this way.”

                    The irony is that those complaining that the media never
                    talk about Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are
                    watching media that talk all the time about Ilhan Omar and
                    Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The news outlets that the MAGA
                    faithful are tuning in to feature “essentially a constant
                    attack on mainstream media that they see as corrupt and in
                    bed with liberal Democrats, and so the entire narrative is
                    that you are being lied to, not told things,” Longwell said.
                    This plays into what was once a healthy skepticism on the
                    right, a refusal to passively accept the narratives being
                    told by elite media outlets. But that healthy skepticism has
                    “jumped the shark,” according to Longwell, to where “it
                    becomes an obsessive way” of thinking, “where you now live
                    in a post-truth nihilism.”

                    Trump followers believe they are independent thinkers,
                    unlike the rest of us, whom they view as sheep, people who
                    are “just sleepwalking through life,” in Longwell’s
                    phrase—too naive, too compliant, too trusting. This explains
                    how the effort to combat COVID-19 was derailed; much of MAGA
                    world rejected what epidemiologists were saying, including
                    about the efficacy of masks and vaccines, and turned the
                    fight against the pandemic into a culture war between those
                    they viewed as arrogant elitists and liberty-loving
                    Americans. In this instance, living in an alternate
                    reality—a place where masks are mocked, hydroxychloroquine
                    is said to be a COVID-19 cure, and calls to

                    are viewed as acts of patriotism—had deadly consequences. So
                    did Trump’s lie about the election, which led to the
                    storming of the Capitol.

                    This is part of what Longwell refers to as a “poisonous
                    information environment,” in which even
                    less-than-enthusiastic Trump voters are disoriented by the
                    flood of misinformation and disinformation. Longwell, in
                    characterizing what focus-group participants have told her,
                    puts it this way: “‘I just don’t know what to believe
                    anymore. I don’t know what’s true.’”

                  <p>
                    Bear in mind that these people are often being sent links
                    and Facebook postings that include false information—but
                    because that information is sent by friends and individuals
                    they trust, they tend to believe what they read, or at least
                    be open to the conspiracy theories being peddled. And the
                    widespread loss of trust in institutions and authority
                    figures, which has been happening for decades, compounds the
                    problem.

                  <p>
                    Longwell also offered insights into a phenomenon that both
                    fascinates and concerns me: political tribalism. Too many
                    behaviors and attitudes are now driven by very strong
                    loyalty to political tribes or social groups, or by
                    antipathy and hatred for those on the other side. Many
                    Americans are coalescing around their mutual resentments and
                    fears. Tribalism is intrinsic to human nature, but it’s
                    growing more acute. Amy Chua, a Yale law professor, has
                    <a
                      href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399562853"

                    >
                    about how in America today, every group feels threatened.
                    That is a prescription not just for misunderstanding, but
                    for more political violence.

                    “You can see it,” Longwell told me. “Once everybody in the
                    group kind of knows that they’re all Trump voters, and they
                    all kind of dislike the left, they immediately identify with
                    their in-group.” They start to bond with one another, she
                    explained, reveling in their shared loathing of figures such
                    as Omar and Ocasio-Cortez.

                  <p>
                    Often, what we think are public-policy debates are really
                    about issues of core identity. This helps explain the
                    unusual intensity surrounding politics these days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Longwell laments what she refers to as the “symbiotic
                    relationship” between Republican voters and politicians. The
                    base is angry, radicalized, and prone to catastrophize;
                    Republican politicians believe that stirring up the base is
                    in their self-interest; and so Republican lawmakers,
                    combined with the right-wing media ecosystem, inflame
                    emotions even more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Longwell holds the Trumpian political class more responsible
                    than she does ordinary voters, though she doesn’t let voters
                    off the hook. But she believes that the former know better
                    and are acting more cynically, while she has some sympathy
                    for many Republican voters. “They’re not bad people,” she
                    insisted. “They’re just—they don’t know what to believe or
                    they have been told a bunch of things that aren’t true.” And
                    that confusion, she argued, has been unscrupulously
                    exploited. “Broadly speaking, I think that there are a lot
                    of people who are out to take advantage of the fact that
                    people don’t quite know what to think.”

                    Many of those who are part of MAGA world are post-truth,
                    subordinating reality to partisanship and ideology, but they
                    are not, strictly speaking, relativists. Or to be more
                    precise: They don’t believe they’re relativists; in fact,
                    they would argue to their dying breath that they’re
                    defending the truth. The problem is that the information
                    sources on which they’re relying, and that they seek out,
                    are built on falsehoods and lies. Many Trump supporters
                    aren’t aware of this, and for complicated reasons many of
                    them are, for now at least, content to live in a world
                    detached from objective facts, from reality, from the way
                    things really and truly are. And without agreement on what
                    constitutes reality, we’re lost.

                    After Trump’s defeat in November, and especially after his
                    effort to overturn the election results and the role he
                    played in provoking an unprecedented attack on the citadel
                    of American democracy, Republican leaders could have moved
                    away from the indecency and corruption that defined the

                    Having alienated college-educated suburban voters, many
                    consequential Republicans decided their best bet is to keep
                    their contracting coalition in a state of constant agitation
                    and fear, combatants in a never-ending culture war,
                    “embattled warriors making a last stand against the demise
                    of everything,” as a friend of mine describes it. And that,
                    in turn, requires them to feed the base even greater
                    falsehoods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That is where we are, at least for now, and it does no one
                    any good—least of all conservatives—to pretend otherwise. We
                    saw how well denial and wishful thinking worked out during
                    the Trump presidency.

                  <p>
                    But where the GOP is now isn’t where it needs to stay. Any
                    party, at any time, can take strides toward decency, honor,
                    and American ideals. It is never too late to do good. But in
                    the current climate, doing good requires some degree of
                    courage, and sometimes courage is not enough to prevail.

                    All Americans should hope the Republican Party regains its
                    philosophical bearings and moral senses. A healthy
                    conservative party is important for the nation, as the
                    Harvard political scientist Daniel Ziblatt has shown, and it
                    can serve as a check on the left’s worst excesses. But today
                    the Republican Party is hardly a healthy conservative party.
                    In fact, it has grown inhospitable to authentic
                    conservatism, and certainly to conservative sensibilities.
                    What we are seeing instead more closely resembles what

                    The temptation for conservatives post-Trump is to train all
                    their fire on the left and on the Biden administration while
                    hoping the Republican Party will self-correct. This is an
                    understandable hope, but it’s misplaced. Conservatives
                    should certainly hold the Biden administration and the left
                    accountable. They should criticize and resist policies and
                    claims they believe are harmful to the public
                    good—withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan,
                    government overreach, efforts to pack the court and
                    undermine religious liberties, and Democratic lawmakers

                    But acknowledge, too, that right now the Republican Party is
                    a grave threat to American democracy—not the only one, of
                    course, but a grave one—and unless and until Republicans
                    summon the wit and the will to salvage the party, ruin will
                    follow.

                    The best thing those who love the Republican Party can do
